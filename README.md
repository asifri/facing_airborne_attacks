# Facing Airborne Attacks on ADS-B Data with Autoencoders


This repository contains a Jupyter notebook to reproduces the experiment in the paper ["Facing Airborne Attacks on ADS-B Data with Autoencoders"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102405).
A link to a Google Colab notebook is present at the top of the file.
You can clone the Colab notebook and execute it in a cloud environment.

The dataset for the experiment is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/4x578h29f6.1

Download the dataset, zip the "data" folder, and upload it to the Colab environment in the file root directory.
After that, you can execute the entire notebook by clicking "Run all" in the "Runtime" tab.

Configurable hyperparameters from the paper are present in the "Constants" section (number 0.3).

Execution of full experiment, including all data preprocessing and model training, will take approximately 1 hour in the cloud environment.
